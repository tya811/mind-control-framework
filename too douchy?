i sort of wondered the same thing, but then i thought, no way.

I would much rather have mind control, voice control, eye control of my planes and my flight sims and all of the software on my computer. I told
microchip about it anyhow. It would alleviate the RSI that i have from the copious amounts of clicking. 

but yeah, its pretty straight forward to build an analog reciever for brain waves. there's a company that does it with monkeys and can make monkeys
walk again. 

i do hope it gets done. that would be a pretty great day for computers everywhere. 

however, you need to ship computers with FREE antivirus, because a ddos attack on someones brain would be farcically annyoing.
